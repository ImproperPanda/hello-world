# hello-world

This is my first read-me file on GitHub!

First off, my name is Wesley. I am pretty new to the world of computing. As someone who knew very little about the inner-workings, or even basic terminology of computers, my learning journey so far has been exciting, challenging  and very rewarding.

I cannot wait to immerse myself even further as I spend more and more time on GitHub!

:D
